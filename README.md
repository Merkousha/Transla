## 📋 Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Required
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# Optional (defaults shown)
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.avalai.ir/v1
```

### Customization

You can modify the translator behavior by editing `openai_translator.py`:

```python
# Change default model
translator = OpenAIBookTranslator(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")

# Change service endpoint
translator = OpenAIBookTranslator(
    api_key="your-key",
    model="gpt-4o",
    base_url="https://api.openai.com/v1"  # Standard OpenAI
)

# Change page overlap
success = translator.translate_book(
    pdf_path="book.pdf",
    output_path="translated_book.docx",
    overlap_paragraphs=2  # More overlap for better context
)
```

## 📊 Output Format

The translator creates a Word document with:

- **Title**: Book Translation
- **Metadata**: 
  - Original Language: English
  - Target Language: Persian
  - Translation Engine: OpenAI-Compatible Service
  - Model: gpt-4o
  - Endpoint: https://api.avalai.ir/v1
  - Page Overlap: Enabled
  - Generation timestamp
- **Content**: 
  - Section headers
  - Original text
  - Translated text
  - Separators between sections

## 🔧 Advanced Settings

### Page Overlap Configuration

```python
# More overlap for better context (default: 1)
overlap_paragraphs = 2

# Less overlap for faster processing
overlap_paragraphs = 0
```

### Chunk Size Configuration

```python
# Modify in split_text_into_chunks method
chunk_size = 3000  # Larger chunks (default: 2000)
chunk_overlap = 300  # More overlap between chunks (default: 200)
```

### Translation Parameters

```python
# Modify in translate_chunk method
temperature = 0.1  # More deterministic (default: 0.3)
max_tokens = 6000  # Longer responses (default: 4000)
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Error**
   ```
   ❌ Error: API key is required
   ```
   **Solution**: Set your API key in `.env` file

2. **Connection Error**
   ```
   ❌ Error: Network connection problem
   ```
   **Solution**: Check your internet connection and service status

3. **Rate Limiting**
   ```
   ❌ Error: Rate limit exceeded
   ```
   **Solution**: Wait a few minutes or reduce request frequency

4. **PDF Reading Error**
   ```
   ❌ Error: Error reading PDF
   ```
   **Solution**: Ensure PDF file exists and is not corrupted

### Testing

Run the test script to verify everything is working:

```bash
python test_openai.py
```

Expected output:
```
🔧 Testing OpenAI-Compatible Service Connection
==================================================
API Key: ✅ Set
Model: gpt-4o
Endpoint: https://api.avalai.ir/v1

✅ OpenAI client initialized successfully
🔄 Testing simple request...
✅ Response received: سلام از OpenAI-compatible service!
🔄 Testing translation...
✅ Translation test: اپلیکیشن را Run کنید و پروژه را Build کنید. API endpoint را بررسی کنید و مشکلات را Debug کنید.
🎉 All tests passed! OpenAI-compatible service is working correctly.
```

## 📈 Performance Tips

1. **Use appropriate chunk size**: Larger chunks for better context, smaller for faster processing
2. **Adjust page overlap**: More overlap for better continuity, less for speed
3. **Monitor rate limits**: Add delays between requests if needed
4. **Use SSD storage**: Faster PDF reading and Word document creation

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- Keep your API key secure and don't share it
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Regularly rotate your API keys
